## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Tasks

- HTML semantic refactoring
- Added alt image text to images and icons
- Updated the title

change HTML elements to semantic tags
restructure the html code to be more logical and optimized
create accessible alt attributes for images
sequentially order heading attributes
create a descriptive title

```

THEN I find semantic HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

```
